        <h2 class="title">IELTS</h2>
        <img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="">
        <p>IELTS score is internationally recognized as an English Language proficiency requirement for immigration or higher education. Especially without an IELTS score you will not be eligible to submit your EOI profile. In our country there are so many organizations offering IELTS courses. Most of the cases they are offering Academic IELTS Course. But as an applicant for immigration you have to take a test in the General Training module. Which is a little bit easier than academic IELTS, but almost the same. <br><br>
            FWS is offering a Special General Training Course for those applicants who want to apply for immigration. This course will also help you to get some good friends for your communication and study in a group. <br><br>
            General Training Module is designed for students seeking immigration, entry to a secondary school or too short course/vocational training courses. The highest possible band score is 9.0 in IELTS. If your target score is CLB 6,7,8,9 or 10. Then this course is only for you. <br><br>
        </p>
